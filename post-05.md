**What does God do? üåç‚ö°Ô∏è**

Like, if God is all-powerful, what's He actually doing? Just watching Netflix in heaven? Micromanaging everything? And if He's in control, why is everything so messed up?

**God creates, sustains, and redeems.** He didn't just make the universe and walk away - He actively upholds every atom, every heartbeat, every moment. Think of it like a video game where the developer is constantly running the code that makes everything work.

**But here's the key:** God works through secondary causes. He sustains the laws of physics, but doesn't override them constantly. He works through people, circumstances, and even natural processes to accomplish His purposes.

**When bad things happen, it's not because God is absent or weak - it's because He's allowing the story to unfold, knowing He can redeem even the worst chapters.**

if God sustains everything, what about climate change? is he just letting the planet die?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@climate_activist Great question! God gave humans dominion over creation, which includes responsibility for environmental stewardship. Climate change is largely result of human choices, not divine neglect. We're called to be part of the solution.

where was God when I was diagnosed? was that part of his plan?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@cancer_survivor I'm so sorry you went through that. God wasn't absent - He was with you in the suffering. Cancer exists because we live in a broken world, but God can work even through our worst experiences for our ultimate good.

if God controls everything, do we actually have free will?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@philosophy_student God's sovereignty and human free will are both true, even though we can't fully understand how they work together. God is so powerful that He can accomplish His purposes while still allowing genuine human choice.

this is stressing me out. does God have a detailed plan for every moment of my life?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@anxious_overthinker You're not a robot following a script! God has an overall plan, but within that, you have real choices and freedom. He's more like a master improviser who can work with whatever you choose.

I was abused as a child. are you saying God planned that?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@trauma_survivor Absolutely not. God hates abuse and injustice. He didn't plan your trauma, but He was with you in it and can bring healing and purpose from even the worst experiences. Your pain matters to Him.

what about evolution and natural selection? does God guide that too?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@science_nerd Many Christians see evolution as God's method of creation. Whether through instant creation or gradual development, God is the ultimate source of all life and complexity.

where was God during COVID? did he cause it or just allow it?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@pandemic_questions God didn't cause COVID, but He allowed it in a world affected by sin and brokenness. Even in the pandemic, we saw His love through healthcare workers, community support, and scientific breakthroughs.

**@control_freak** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
if God's in control, why should I even try to make good choices?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@control_freak Because your choices matter! God works through your decisions, efforts, and actions. You're not passive - you're a co-worker with God in His purposes.

**@hopeful_but_confused** ‚Ä¢ *10 hours ago*
how do I trust God's plan when I can't see the big picture?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *9 hours ago*
@hopeful_but_confused That's where faith comes in. You don't have to see the whole puzzle to trust the puzzle-maker. Focus on what you can see: God's character, His past faithfulness, and His promises.
