**What about people who never hear about Jesus? Is that fair? üåçüíî**

There are billions of people who have never heard the gospel clearly. Are they all condemned? What about people in remote places or different time periods?

**This is one of the most difficult questions in Christianity.** Here's what we know:

‚úÖ God is perfectly just and loving
‚úÖ Jesus is the only way to salvation  
‚úÖ People are judged based on what they know
‚úÖ This is why missions matter so urgently

God will judge righteously, taking into account what people knew and how they responded. But we don't leave it to chance - we share the gospel so everyone can hear about Jesus' love.

**The question isn't just "what about them?" but "what about us?" Will we share the good news?**

this seems unfair. why not just save everyone? wouldn't that be more loving?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@universalist_inclination Love doesn't force itself on people. God offers salvation to everyone, but He doesn't override human choice. True love allows for the possibility of rejection.

**@inclusivism_questions** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
what about people who follow God through other religions? could Jesus save them without them knowing it?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@inclusivism_questions Christians have different views on this. Some believe God may work through general revelation in ways we don't fully understand. But this is why clear gospel proclamation is so important - so people can know for sure.

**@historical_concern** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
what about people who lived before Jesus came? were they all condemned?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@historical_concern Old Testament believers were saved by faith in God's promises about a coming Savior. They looked forward to Christ; we look back to Christ. Same salvation, different timing.

**@geographical_injustice** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
it seems unfair that where you're born determines your eternal destiny

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@geographical_injustice God's plan includes using His people to reach every nation and tongue. The unfairness isn't God's fault - it's our failure to prioritize missions and evangelism. That's why the Great Commission matters so much.

**@natural_revelation** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about Romans 1? doesn't that say people can know God through creation?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@natural_revelation Yes! General revelation shows that God exists and is powerful. But it doesn't tell us about Jesus or how to be saved. It makes people "without excuse" for rejecting God, but they still need to hear the gospel.

**@missionary_motivation** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
this makes missions feel urgent but also overwhelming. how do we reach everyone?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@missionary_motivation You're right - it is urgent! But remember, God calls all of us to participate: some go, some send, some support, some pray. You don't have to reach everyone, but you can reach someone.

what about babies who die? they haven't heard the gospel either

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@infant_salvation Most Christians believe babies who die are covered by God's grace. They haven't rejected the gospel because they haven't had the capacity to understand it. God's mercy extends to those who cannot choose.

**@mental_capacity** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about people with intellectual disabilities who can't understand the gospel?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@mental_capacity God judges according to capacity and opportunity. Those who lack the mental ability to understand abstract concepts aren't held to the same standard. God is both just and compassionate.

**@cultural_barriers** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
what about when the gospel is presented poorly or mixed with colonialism? does that count as "hearing"?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@cultural_barriers That's a crucial question! We need to share the gospel clearly and respectfully, stripped of cultural imperialism. Poor presentation doesn't excuse us from sharing better, more authentic gospel witness.

**@personal_responsibility** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
this is convicting. I've been so focused on my own spiritual life that I forget about sharing with others

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@personal_responsibility That's a healthy conviction! Start where you are - with friends, family, neighbors. You don't have to travel overseas to be a missionary. Every Christian is called to share their faith somehow.
