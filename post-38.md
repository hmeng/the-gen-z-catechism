**Can you lose your salvation? What about backsliding? üò∞üîí**

I've heard Christians argue about this forever. "Once saved, always saved" vs. "you can fall away." Which is it? Can I mess up so badly that God gives up on me?

**True believers persevere to the end.** Not because we're strong enough to hold on to God, but because He's strong enough to hold on to us. Salvation isn't something you maintain - it's something Jesus completed.

Think of it like this: if salvation depends on your performance, you'd lose it every day. But if it depends on Jesus' performance, you're secure forever.

**This doesn't mean you can live however you want. It means that genuine faith will endure, even through struggles and failures.**

but what if I backslide? I went through a period where I didn't feel connected to God at all

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@backsliding_fears Spiritual dry seasons and struggles don't mean you lose salvation! Even if you wander, if you have genuine faith, God will draw you back. The prodigal son was still a son even when he was far from home.

**@license_to_sin** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
doesn't this give people license to sin? if you can't lose salvation, why be good?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@license_to_sin People who truly understand grace don't abuse it - they're overwhelmed by it! When you really grasp how much Jesus loves you, you want to live for Him. Love motivates better than fear.

**@apostasy_examples** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
what about people who used to be Christian but now reject faith entirely?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@apostasy_examples That's heartbreaking to see. Either they'll return to faith (showing it was genuine) or they never had saving faith to begin with (just cultural Christianity). Only God knows hearts fully.

**@arminian_perspective** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
but doesn't the Bible warn about falling away? what about Hebrews 6?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@arminian_perspective Those warnings are real and meant to keep us close to Christ! But they're addressed to the church community, not necessarily proving individuals can lose salvation. They're like guardrails - meant to prevent falling, not predict it.

**@assurance_anxiety** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
this makes me anxious. how do I know if my faith is genuine enough to persevere?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@assurance_anxiety The fact that you're concerned about your faith is actually evidence it's real! Focus on trusting Jesus, not evaluating your faith. Your security comes from His faithfulness, not yours.

**@moral_failure** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what if I commit a really serious sin? can that break my salvation?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@moral_failure No sin is bigger than Jesus' sacrifice! If you've truly trusted Christ, not even serious moral failure can separate you from God's love. Sin has consequences, but it doesn't undo salvation.

**@conditional_security** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
so salvation is unconditional once you have it? that seems too easy

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@conditional_security Salvation isn't earned by conditions, but it does produce results. True faith will show itself through perseverance, good works, and love for God. The security is unconditional, but it's not without evidence.

**@discipleship_costs** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about Jesus saying to count the cost of discipleship? doesn't that imply you can back out?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@discipleship_costs That's about making sure you understand what you're signing up for! True discipleship is costly, but those who truly follow Jesus will continue following, even through difficulties.

**@presumption_danger** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
how do we avoid presumption? thinking we're saved when we're not?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@presumption_danger Look for fruit in your life: love for God and others, hatred of sin, desire to grow. But remember, assurance comes primarily from God's promise, not self-examination. Trust His word, not just your feelings.

**@comfort_in_struggles** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
this is actually really comforting during my mental health struggles. I was worried God would abandon me

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@comfort_in_struggles God will never abandon you! Mental health struggles don't disqualify you from His love. He knows your frame and remembers you're dust. His grip on you is stronger than your grip on Him.
