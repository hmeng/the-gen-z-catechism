# Post #30: Who is Jesus Christ?

## üì± Post #30

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 weeks ago*

**Who is Jesus Christ? Teacher? Prophet? God? Influencer? ü§î‚ú®**

Everyone has an opinion about Jesus - great moral teacher, revolutionary, myth, or Lord. But who is He actually? And why does it matter?

**Jesus is fully God and fully human in one person.** Not half-God, not sometimes God - He's 100% divine and 100% human simultaneously. This isn't math, it's mystery.

Why does this matter? Because only God can save us, but only a human can represent us. Jesus had to be both to bridge the gap between God and humanity.

Think of it like a translator who's completely fluent in both languages. Jesus speaks both "God" and "human" perfectly because He IS both.

**He's not just a good example to follow - He's the Savior who rescues us.**

but other religions see Jesus differently. Muslims say he's a prophet, not God

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
@world_religions_student That's true! Different religions have different views of Jesus. But we have to look at what Jesus actually claimed about Himself. He claimed to be God, not just a prophet or teacher.

**@logical_thinker** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
how can someone be 100% God and 100% human? that's literally impossible

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
@logical_thinker You're right that it defies human logic! But think about it - if God became human, wouldn't that be beyond our full understanding? The infinite entering the finite is bound to be mysterious.

**@historical_skeptic** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
how do we even know Jesus existed? maybe he's just a legend

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
@historical_skeptic The historical evidence for Jesus' existence is actually very strong - even most non-Christian historians accept that Jesus was a real person. The question isn't whether He existed, but who He was.

**@moral_teacher_view** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
why can't Jesus just be a great moral teacher? isn't that enough?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@moral_teacher_view C.S. Lewis had a great point about this: If Jesus claimed to be God but wasn't, He'd be either a liar or delusional - not a great moral teacher. You have to take His claims seriously.

**@incarnation_confusion** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
so did Jesus know he was God when he was a baby? this is confusing

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@incarnation_confusion Great question! Jesus' divine nature was always there, but His human consciousness developed normally. He grew "in wisdom and stature" like any human child, while remaining fully God.

**@suffering_questions** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
if Jesus was God, did he actually suffer on the cross? can God suffer?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@suffering_questions Yes, Jesus truly suffered - in His human nature. God chose to experience human suffering through the incarnation. This shows how much He loves us - He entered our pain.

**@practical_implications** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
why does this matter for my daily life though?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@practical_implications It changes everything! Jesus understands your human struggles (because He's human) while having divine power to help you (because He's God). You have a Savior who gets it AND can do something about it.

**@alternative_christologies** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about other views - Jesus as just divine, or just human, or adopted by God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@alternative_christologies Those were all early heresies that the church rejected because they don't solve the problem. If Jesus isn't fully God, He can't save us. If He isn't fully human, He can't represent us.

**@trinity_questions** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
how does Jesus being God fit with the Trinity? is there more than one God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@trinity_questions Jesus is the second person of the Trinity - one God in three persons. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct persons but one God. Jesus is God, but He's not the Father or the Spirit.

**@personal_relationship** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
this sounds theological but how do I actually relate to Jesus personally?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@personal_relationship You can talk to Him like you would any person (prayer), learn about Him (Scripture), and trust in what He's done for you (faith). Because He's both God and human, He's perfectly relatable and perfectly powerful.
