# Post #56: What happens when we die?

## üì± Post #56

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*

**What actually happens when we die? Where do we go? üíÄ‚ú®**

Death feels scary and mysterious. Do we go straight to heaven? Sleep until resurrection? Become ghosts? The whole thing feels overwhelming.

**When Christians die, they go immediately to be with Jesus.** Your soul/spirit goes to heaven while your body stays in the grave until the resurrection. You don't sleep or wait - you're conscious and joyful in God's presence.

**Here's the timeline:**
1. **Death** - your spirit leaves your body
2. **Intermediate state** - you're with Jesus in heaven  
3. **Resurrection** - Jesus returns and you get a new body
4. **Eternal life** - forever with God on the new earth

**Death is the last enemy, but Jesus defeated it. For Christians, death is like falling asleep and waking up in paradise.**

**@soul_sleep_debate** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
what about soul sleep? don't we just sleep until the resurrection?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@soul_sleep_debate Some Christians believe in soul sleep, but most believe in immediate consciousness with Christ. Jesus told the thief "today you will be with me in paradise," and Paul said "to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord."

**@fear_of_death** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
I'm terrified of dying. how do I overcome this fear?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@fear_of_death Fear of death is natural! Remember that Jesus conquered death and will be with you. Death is not the end but the doorway to perfect life. Focus on living fully now while trusting God with your future.

**@what_about_hell** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
what happens to non-Christians when they die? do they go straight to hell?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@what_about_hell This is one of the hardest truths in Christianity. Those who reject Christ face eternal separation from God. But remember, God is perfectly just and loving. He doesn't want anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.

**@near_death_experiences** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about near-death experiences? people claim to visit heaven and come back

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@near_death_experiences These experiences are interesting but we shouldn't base our theology on them. Scripture is our reliable guide to what happens after death. Some NDEs may be real glimpses, others may be brain chemistry - we can't be certain.

**@grieving_process** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
my Christian loved one died. should I be sad or happy they're in heaven?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@grieving_process Both! You can rejoice that they're with Jesus AND grieve your loss. Jesus wept at Lazarus' death even though He was about to raise him. Grief is love with nowhere to go - it's natural and healthy.

**@suicide_and_salvation** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about Christians who die by suicide? do they lose their salvation?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@suicide_and_salvation Suicide doesn't disqualify someone from salvation if they truly trusted Christ. Mental illness can cloud judgment just like physical illness affects the body. God is merciful and understands human frailty.

**@purgatory_question** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
what about purgatory? don't we need to be purified before heaven?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@purgatory_question Most Protestants don't believe in purgatory because Christ's sacrifice completely purifies us. When you die, you're immediately made perfect and ready for God's presence. No additional purification needed!

**@resurrection_bodies** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
what will our resurrection bodies be like? will we recognize each other?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@resurrection_bodies They'll be like Jesus' resurrection body - physical but perfected! No more aging, sickness, or decay. Yes, you'll recognize others and be recognized. It's the same you, just perfected.

**@timing_questions** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
how long will we be in the intermediate state? when is the resurrection?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@timing_questions The Bible doesn't give us a timeline. The resurrection happens when Jesus returns, which could be soon or far in the future. But remember, from your perspective after death, time may feel very different.

**@comfort_for_dying** ‚Ä¢ *10 hours ago*
my grandparent is dying. what can I tell them about what's coming?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *9 hours ago*
@comfort_for_dying If they trust Jesus, they're going to perfect peace, no more pain, and His loving presence. They'll see loved ones who died in faith. Death is like walking through a doorway into light. Be present and remind them of God's love.
