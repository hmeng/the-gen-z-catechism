**What is repentance? Just feeling bad about stuff? üòûüîÑ**

The word "repentance" sounds heavy and religious. Is it just guilt and shame? A one-time thing? Something you have to be perfect at?

**Repentance is changing your mind and changing direction.** It's not just feeling sorry - it's turning from sin toward God. Like doing a U-turn when you realize you're going the wrong way.

Repentance has three parts:
1. **Recognition** - admitting you've done wrong
2. **Remorse** - genuine sorrow about it  
3. **Reformation** - actually changing course

Think of it like this: if you accidentally hurt a friend, you don't just say "my bad" and keep doing it. You genuinely feel bad AND change your behavior.

**Repentance isn't about becoming perfect - it's about heading in the right direction.**

what's the difference between healthy repentance and toxic guilt?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@guilt_vs_conviction Great question! Healthy repentance leads to change and freedom. Toxic guilt just spirals into shame and self-condemnation. Repentance says "I did wrong but can be forgiven." Toxic guilt says "I am wrong and can't be fixed."

**@perfectionism_trap** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
but what if I keep sinning in the same areas? does that mean my repentance isn't real?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@perfectionism_trap Repentance is a direction, not perfection! Even if you stumble in the same areas, the question is: are you still fighting sin and seeking God's help? That's ongoing repentance.

**@one_time_event** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
is repentance something you do once when you become a Christian, or ongoing?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@one_time_event Both! There's initial repentance when you first turn to Christ, and then daily repentance as you continue to grow. Martin Luther said all of life should be repentance.

**@emotional_component** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what if I don't feel that bad about my sin? am I not really repentant?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@emotional_component Emotions are important but not everything! Sometimes repentance is recognizing sin is wrong even when you don't feel terrible about it. The will to change matters more than the intensity of feeling.

**@behavioral_change** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
how much do I need to change to prove my repentance is real?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@behavioral_change Real repentance will show itself in your life over time, but don't get trapped in performance metrics! The heart change is what matters most, and that's between you and God.

**@addiction_struggles** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
I want to repent of addiction but I keep relapsing. is God tired of my repentance?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@addiction_struggles God never gets tired of genuine repentance! Addiction is complex and recovery often involves setbacks. Keep turning to God for help - His grace is bigger than your struggle.

**@social_sins** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about repenting from systemic sins like racism or inequality? how does that work?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@social_sins Great question! Repentance includes both personal attitudes and working to change unjust systems. If you've benefited from or participated in injustice, repentance means both heart change AND action.

**@public_confession** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
do I need to confess sins publicly or just to God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@public_confession Confession to God is essential. Public confession depends on the situation - if your sin harmed others, you may need to make amends. But you don't need to broadcast every sin publicly.

**@fruit_of_repentance** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
how can I tell if my repentance is genuine?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@fruit_of_repentance Look for "fruit" over time: genuine sorrow for sin, desire to change, actually making efforts to change, seeking God's help, making amends where possible. The Holy Spirit will produce real change.

**@cultural_repentance** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
what about things that were normal in the past but we now see as wrong? do we repent of cultural blindness?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@cultural_repentance Absolutely! When God opens our eyes to sins we didn't see before - whether personal or cultural - the right response is humble repentance and changed action going forward.
