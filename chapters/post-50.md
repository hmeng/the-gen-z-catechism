# Post #50: What about money and possessions?

## üì± Post #50

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*

**What should Christians think about money? Is being wealthy sinful? üí∞ü§î**

Money feels complicated. Some Christians seem to think poverty is more spiritual, others seem to think wealth is God's blessing. What's the biblical view on finances?

**Money isn't evil, but the love of money is.** Wealth can be a blessing or a curse depending on your heart attitude. God cares more about how you earn, spend, and think about money than how much you have.

**Biblical money principles:**
- **Earn** honestly and work diligently
- **Give** generously and joyfully  
- **Save** wisely for the future
- **Spend** thoughtfully on needs and some wants
- **Hold** everything loosely as God's property

**Money is a tool for loving God and others, not a trophy for yourself.**

**@prosperity_gospel** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
what about prosperity gospel? that God wants all Christians to be wealthy?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@prosperity_gospel That's not biblical! God's main promise isn't wealth but His presence. Many faithful Christians are poor, and many wealthy people are far from God. True prosperity is spiritual health, not just financial success.

I'm drowning in student debt. how do I trust God with my finances when everything feels overwhelming?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@student_debt_anxiety Financial stress is real and God understands! Make a plan, seek wise counsel, live within your means, and remember that your worth isn't determined by your net worth. God cares more about your character than your credit score.

**@tithing_questions** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
what about tithing? do Christians have to give 10%? what if I can barely afford rent?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@tithing_questions The 10% tithe was Old Testament law. New Testament teaches generous, joyful giving according to your ability. If you're struggling to meet basic needs, start small and grow in generosity as God provides.

**@rich_young_ruler** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
Jesus told the rich young ruler to sell everything. does that apply to all wealthy Christians?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@rich_young_ruler Jesus addressed that man's specific idol - his wealth had become his god. Not everyone needs to sell everything, but everyone needs to hold their possessions loosely and be willing to give them up if God asks.

**@simple_living** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what about simple living and minimalism? is that more Christian?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@simple_living Simple living can be helpful for focusing on what matters! But it's the heart attitude that counts, not the number of possessions. You can be materialistic with few things or generous with many things.

**@gambling_investing** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about gambling, investing, cryptocurrency? where's the line between wise investing and sinful speculation?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@gambling_investing Wise investing builds wealth over time for good purposes. Gambling seeks quick gain through chance. Ask: Am I being a good steward or am I being greedy? Am I gambling money I can't afford to lose?

**@social_justice_wealth** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
how do I balance enjoying God's blessings with caring about global poverty?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@social_justice_wealth Great tension to feel! Enjoy God's gifts with gratitude while also sharing generously. You don't have to feel guilty for every blessing, but let your awareness of others' needs shape your giving and lifestyle choices.

**@financial_planning** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
is it wrong to plan for retirement or save for the future? shouldn't I just trust God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@financial_planning Planning and trusting aren't opposites! Proverbs praises the ant for preparing for winter. Save wisely while holding your plans loosely. Trust God with the outcome, but be responsible with what He's given you.

**@spending_on_wants** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
is it okay to buy things I want but don't need? like nice clothes or eating out?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@spending_on_wants God gives us richly all things to enjoy! The key is moderation and generosity. If you're giving generously and meeting your responsibilities, enjoying some wants is fine. Just don't let wants become idols.

**@economic_systems** ‚Ä¢ *10 hours ago*
what economic system does the Bible support? capitalism? socialism?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *9 hours ago*
@economic_systems The Bible gives principles more than systems - work, generosity, care for the poor, honest business. Christians can work within various economic systems to promote justice, opportunity, and human flourishing.
