## 📱 Post #47

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *5 days ago*

**How should we treat our bodies? Self-care or self-discipline? 💪🧘‍♀️**

Between wellness culture saying "treat your body like a temple" and diet culture saying "discipline your flesh," what's the Christian perspective on our physical selves?

**Both and neither.** Your body IS a temple - but not for yourself. It's a temple of the Holy Spirit. This means:

✅ Self-care isn't selfish - it's stewardship
✅ Your body has inherent dignity (made in God's image)
✅ Health is good, but not the ultimate good
✅ You can honor God through both discipline AND rest

**Avoid these extremes:**
❌ Body as machine (optimize everything)
❌ Body as enemy (spirituality = hating physical)
❌ Body as god (appearance/performance = identity)

**Think stewardship, not ownership.** You're caring for something precious that belongs to God.

so is it wrong to want to look good? asking for a friend 👀

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *4 days ago*
@fitness_influencer Not wrong at all! Taking care of your appearance can be part of good stewardship. The issue comes when your identity or worth depends on how you look.

**@eating_disorder_recovery** • *4 days ago*
this is actually really helpful. I've been struggling with seeing my body as the enemy

**@body_positive_advocate** • *4 days ago*
@eating_disorder_recovery yes! your body isn't something to fight against, it's something to care for with compassion

**@chronic_illness_warrior** • *4 days ago*
what about when your body doesn't work "right"? am I failing at stewardship?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *4 days ago*
@chronic_illness_warrior Not at all! Stewarding a chronically ill body looks different than stewarding a healthy one. You're not responsible for having the illness, but you are responsible for how you care for yourself within your limitations.

**@gym_bro_christian** • *4 days ago*
bro the body is the temple, gotta keep it STRONG 💪

**@contemplative_christian** • *4 days ago*
@gym_bro_christian nothing wrong with being strong! but remember the temple was for worship, not just for show

**@mental_health_advocate** • *3 days ago*
what about mental health? is taking meds trusting God or not trusting God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *3 days ago*
@mental_health_advocate Taking medication is stewardship! God gave us brains to develop medicine. Would you refuse insulin for diabetes? Mental health is health.

**@fasting_curiosity** • *3 days ago*
what about fasting? is that good discipline or harmful restriction?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *3 days ago*
@fasting_curiosity Fasting can be a healthy spiritual practice when done wisely and for the right reasons. But it should never be about punishment or control - it's about focusing on God.

**@diet_culture_survivor** • *3 days ago*
I love that this doesn't make health an idol but also doesn't dismiss self-care

**@disability_advocate** • *3 days ago*
thank you for including the chronic illness perspective. so many Christian health posts assume everyone has the same capabilities

**@wellness_culture** • *2 days ago*
what about all the "clean living" and "toxin-free" trends? is that biblical stewardship?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *2 days ago*
@wellness_culture Some wellness practices are helpful, others are marketing. Use wisdom, avoid obsession, and remember that perfect health isn't the goal - faithful stewardship is.

**@addiction_recovery** • *1 day ago*
I'm in recovery from substance abuse. how does this apply to addiction?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *1 day ago*
@addiction_recovery Recovery is absolutely stewardship! You're caring for your body and mind by avoiding substances that harm you. God celebrates your sobriety and supports your healing journey.
