**What is sin exactly? üòà‚öñÔ∏è**

Between "don't judge," moral relativism, and "your truth" - how do we even define what's wrong anymore? Is sin just outdated shame or something real?

**Sin is missing the mark of God's perfect standard.** It's not just "being bad" - it's falling short of who God designed you to be. Think of it like a GPS that's slightly off - you might think you're going the right way, but you'll never reach your destination.

Sin isn't just actions - it's the condition of our hearts. We're all born with a bent toward selfishness, pride, and rebellion against God. This shows up in everything from white lies to systemic injustice.

**Sin isn't about God being a cosmic killjoy - it's about recognizing that we've all fallen short of perfect love.**

but who decides what's "wrong"? different cultures have different values

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@moral_relativist That's exactly why we need an objective standard! If there's no real right and wrong, then concepts like justice, equality, and human rights become meaningless. God's character provides the universal moral foundation.

**@dont_judge_culture** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
this sounds really judgmental. I thought Jesus said "don't judge"?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@dont_judge_culture Jesus did warn against hypocritical judgment, but He also talked about sin constantly! The difference is judging with humility, recognizing we're all sinners in need of grace, vs. judging from a place of superiority.

what's wrong with "living your truth"? shouldn't we be authentic?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@your_truth_believer Authenticity is good, but "your truth" can sometimes conflict with actual truth and harm others. We need both authenticity AND moral standards that protect human dignity and flourishing.

**@systemic_sin** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
what about systemic sins like racism? is that just individual sin or something bigger?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@systemic_sin Great question! Sin affects individuals AND systems. Racism, for example, involves both personal prejudice and unjust structures that perpetuate harm. Both need to be addressed.

**@shame_vs_guilt** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
is there a difference between healthy guilt and toxic shame?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@shame_vs_guilt Yes! Guilt says "I did something wrong" (specific action). Shame says "I am something wrong" (identity). Healthy conviction about sin leads to repentance and change, not crushing self-hatred.

**@white_lies** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
are "little" sins really that bad? like white lies or small selfishness?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@white_lies All sin matters because it damages relationships and reflects our broken hearts. But context matters too - protecting someone's feelings isn't the same as malicious deception. The heart behind the action matters.

**@mental_health** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about mental illness? am I sinning when depression makes me selfish?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@mental_health Mental illness affects your capacity but doesn't automatically make you sinful. God understands your struggles. Focus on getting help and doing your best within your limitations, not on perfect performance.

**@original_sin** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what's this "original sin" thing? why am I responsible for what Adam did?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@original_sin You're not responsible for Adam's specific sin, but we all inherit the broken human condition. It's like being born into a family with genetic predispositions - not your fault, but your reality.

**@good_person** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
I try to be a good person though. isn't that enough?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@good_person The desire to be good is beautiful! But the standard isn't "good enough" - it's perfect love. None of us reach that. Recognizing our need for grace is actually the beginning of real goodness.

**@social_justice** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
how does personal sin relate to social justice issues?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@social_justice They're connected! Personal sins like greed and prejudice create unjust systems. Working for justice is part of fighting sin's effects in the world. Both personal transformation and systemic change matter.
