# Post #37: What happens when we're saved?

---

## üì± Post #37

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*

**What actually happens when we're saved? Like, internally? üîÑ‚ú®**

Is it just a legal transaction in heaven, or does something real change in me? Do I become a different person instantly?

**Two things happen: you're declared righteous (justification) AND you're made new (regeneration).** God both changes your legal status and starts changing your heart.

Think of it like this:
- **Justification** = God declares you "not guilty" 
- **Regeneration** = God gives you a new heart that wants to follow Him

It's like getting both a presidential pardon AND a heart transplant. Your record is cleared AND your desires start changing.

**You're not just forgiven - you're transformed. The change is real, even if it's gradual.**

so does everything change immediately or over time? I still struggle with the same things

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@instant_vs_gradual Some changes are instant (your relationship with God, freedom from condemnation), others are gradual (character, habits, patterns). You're a new person learning to live like one!

**@moral_transformation** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
what if I don't feel different? shouldn't being "born again" be more dramatic?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@moral_transformation Not everyone has dramatic feelings! The new birth is primarily about your spiritual state, not your emotions. Look for subtle changes: new desires to know God, care for others, hatred of sin.

**@addiction_struggles** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
I became a Christian but still struggle with addiction. did God not really save me?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@addiction_struggles God absolutely saved you! Salvation doesn't instantly cure addiction or other struggles. But you now have the Holy Spirit's power to fight these battles. Recovery is part of your transformation journey.

**@perfectionism_expectations** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
I expected to be more holy by now. does slow change mean I'm doing something wrong?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@perfectionism_expectations Sanctification (becoming holy) is a lifelong process! God is patient with your growth. The fact that you want to be more holy is actually evidence that He's working in you.

**@old_vs_new_self** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about the "old self" vs "new self"? sometimes I feel like I'm two different people

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@old_vs_new_self That's normal! You're in transition - the old patterns are dying but not dead, the new nature is real but still growing. It's like renovation - messy in the middle but beautiful when complete.

**@assurance_based_on_change** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
should I base my assurance of salvation on how much I've changed?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@assurance_based_on_change Your assurance should be based on Christ's finished work, not your progress! Change is evidence of salvation, but it's not the foundation of your confidence. Trust His faithfulness, not your performance.

**@mental_health_impact** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
will being saved help with my depression and anxiety?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@mental_health_impact Salvation gives you hope, purpose, and God's presence in your struggles. But it doesn't automatically cure mental illness. You may still need therapy, medication, and professional help - and that's okay!

**@social_justice_implications** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
if we're made new, shouldn't Christians care more about injustice and inequality?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@social_justice_implications Absolutely! A new heart that loves God will also love what God loves - including justice and mercy. Caring for the oppressed should be a natural result of transformation.

**@relational_changes** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
my relationships feel different since becoming a Christian. is that normal?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@relational_changes Very normal! When you change, your relationships change too. Some get better (as you love more selflessly), some get strained (different values), some need boundaries (toxic patterns).

**@timeline_expectations** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
how long does this transformation take? I want to be patient but also see progress

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@timeline_expectations It's a lifetime process! Some changes happen quickly, others take years. Focus on direction rather than speed. Are you more like Jesus today than last year? That's progress worth celebrating.
