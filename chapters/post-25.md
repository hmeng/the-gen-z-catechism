# Post #25: Can we fix ourselves?

## üì± Post #25

**Can we fix ourselves? Self-improvement, therapy, willpower? üí™üîß**

Between life coaches, self-help books, and personal development content, can't we just bootstrap our way to being better people? Why do we need God when we have therapy and meditation?

**You can improve yourself, but you can't save yourself.** Think of it like this: if you're drowning, swimming lessons are great, but what you really need is a lifeguard.

Self-improvement can help with symptoms (anxiety, habits, relationships), but it can't fix the core problem (your separation from God). You can't think your way out of total depravity or manifest your way into righteousness.

**This isn't anti-therapy or anti-growth. It's recognizing that human effort has limits, and salvation isn't one of them.**

this sounds like it discourages personal growth. I've genuinely improved through therapy and mindfulness

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@self_help_enthusiast That's wonderful! Personal growth is good and healthy. The point is that while you can improve your life, you can't fix your fundamental relationship with God through self-effort alone. Both/and, not either/or.

**@bootstraps_mentality** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
what about people who pull themselves up by their bootstraps? success stories prove we can change

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@bootstraps_mentality Success stories are inspiring! But they usually involve overcoming external circumstances or changing behaviors. The spiritual issue goes deeper - it's about our nature, not just our actions.

are you saying therapy doesn't work? that's harmful to people who need mental health support

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@therapy_advocate Not at all! Therapy is incredibly valuable for mental health, trauma recovery, and life skills. I'm saying it can't solve the spiritual problem of sin. We need both psychological healing AND spiritual salvation.

meditation and mindfulness have genuinely transformed my life. isn't that spiritual growth?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@meditation_practitioner Those practices can be very helpful for well-being! But spiritual transformation and salvation from sin are different issues. You can be mindful and still be separated from God.

**@addiction_recovery** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
recovery programs say we're powerless over addiction. is that similar to what you're saying?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@addiction_recovery Yes! Recovery wisdom recognizes that willpower alone isn't enough - you need a higher power and community support. That's similar to recognizing our need for God's power in salvation.

what about moral progress? society has improved in many ways through human effort

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@moral_philosopher Social progress is real and good! But it's often driven by people acting on values that come from God's image in them. Plus, for every improvement, we see new forms of evil emerge.

**@anxious_perfectionist** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
this is actually relieving. I've been exhausted trying to fix myself

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@anxious_perfectionist Yes! There's freedom in recognizing your limits. You can stop carrying the weight of saving yourself and let God do what only He can do. Then you can focus on growth from a place of acceptance, not desperation.

**@humanistic_psychology** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
but doesn't this create learned helplessness? if we can't fix ourselves, why try?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@humanistic_psychology Not helplessness - dependence on God! You still work on growth, but you're not trying to earn salvation. It's like the difference between exercising for health vs. exercising to not die.

**@spiritual_but_not_religious** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
can't we just connect with the universe or our higher self? why specifically God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@spiritual_but_not_religious The problem is that the "universe" and "higher self" are just other names for you - you're still trying to save yourself. Only the God who created you can truly fix what's broken.
