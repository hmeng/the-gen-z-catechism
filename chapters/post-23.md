# Post #23: How bad is sin really?

## üì± Post #23

**How bad is sin really? Aren't most people basically good? ü§îüí≠**

Like, sure, nobody's perfect, but most people aren't murderers or abusers. Can't we just try harder to be good? Why does Christianity make such a big deal about sin?

**Sin is worse than you think.** It's not just bad actions - it's the corruption of your entire being. Every thought, motivation, and desire is tainted by self-centeredness. You're not just sick - you're dead in sin.

This doesn't mean you're as bad as you could be. It means you're affected by sin in every part of your being. Think of it like a computer virus that doesn't destroy every file, but corrupts the operating system so nothing works right.

**The good news? If you're dead in sin, only God can bring you back to life. You can't save yourself, but you don't have to.**

this is so negative though. I see people doing good things all the time. what about heroes and saints?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@humanistic_optimist You're right that people do good things! The image of God in us isn't totally destroyed. But even our good actions are often mixed with selfish motives. We help others because it makes us feel good, or for social credit, or to ease our guilt.

**@moral_relativist** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
who decides what's "corruption"? maybe we're just evolving beyond old moral categories

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@moral_relativist If there's no objective moral standard, then words like "justice," "equality," and "human rights" become meaningless. The fact that we all instinctively know some things are wrong points to a universal moral law.

**@depression_sufferer** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
"dead in sin" sounds like how I feel with depression. is that the same thing?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@depression_sufferer I'm sorry you're struggling with depression. That's not the same as being spiritually dead - that's a medical condition that needs treatment. Being "dead in sin" is about our relationship with God, not about mental health.

**@self_improvement** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
what about people who genuinely work to improve themselves? meditation, therapy, personal growth?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@self_improvement Self-improvement is great! But it can't fix the fundamental problem of our separation from God. It's like putting a fresh coat of paint on a house with a cracked foundation - helpful, but not addressing the core issue.

**@social_justice_advocate** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
so people fighting for justice and equality - that's all tainted by sin too?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@social_justice_advocate Fighting for justice reflects God's image in us and is good! But even our justice work can be motivated by pride, tribal loyalty, or desire for control. Pure motives are harder to achieve than we think.

**@atheist_philosophy** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
this sounds like learned helplessness. if we're all corrupt, why try to be good at all?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@atheist_philosophy Understanding our corruption should make us humble, not hopeless! We should still pursue good, but recognize we need God's help. It's about realistic self-assessment, not giving up.

**@christian_perfectionist** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
wait, so even my good Christian works are tainted? that's discouraging

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@christian_perfectionist It's actually freeing! Your worth isn't based on the purity of your motives. God sees your heart and accepts you in Christ. You can serve Him without the pressure of perfect motivation.

**@trauma_survivor** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
I've been abused. are you saying I'm just as corrupt as my abuser?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@trauma_survivor Absolutely not! Total depravity doesn't mean equal corruption. Your abuser chose to act on their corruption in deeply harmful ways. You're not responsible for their choices, and their sin doesn't make you less valuable.

**@hopeful_seeker** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
if we're all this corrupt, how can there be hope?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@hopeful_seeker That's the beautiful thing about grace! Because we can't save ourselves, God does all the saving. Our corruption means we need a savior, but it doesn't mean we're beyond saving.
