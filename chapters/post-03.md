**What is God like? 👨‍👧‍👦✨**

Between daddy issues, toxic masculinity, and authority trauma, how do we even think about God? Is He just a cosmic micromanager or an absent father figure?

**God is perfect in every way.** He's loving but not permissive. Powerful but not abusive. Just but not cruel. Present but not suffocating. He's literally everything you wish your earthly father was, and infinitely more.

Think of the best qualities you've ever seen in anyone - infinite kindness, perfect wisdom, unshakeable strength, boundless creativity, unwavering loyalty. God has all of these perfectly, with no toxic traits mixed in.

**He's not your emotionally unavailable dad or your controlling ex. He's the perfect parent/friend/leader you've always needed.**

this is hard for me because every father figure in my life has been toxic. how do I separate that?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *1 day ago*
@daddy_issues_club I'm so sorry you've experienced that. It's totally understandable to struggle with father imagery. Remember: God isn't like earthly fathers - earthly fathers are supposed to be like God, but they fail. He's the original, perfect version.

why is God always described as male though? seems limiting

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *1 day ago*
@feminist_theologian Great question! God isn't literally male - He's beyond gender. But Jesus called God "Father" to show us the kind of relationship we can have: intimate, protective, providing. The Bible also uses maternal imagery for God.

this sounds like spiritual bypassing. shouldn't we process our trauma instead of just believing in perfect God?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *1 day ago*
@therapy_culture Both! God wants you to be whole, which includes processing trauma. But knowing God's perfect character can actually help healing - you learn what healthy love looks like.

how can God be all-powerful and all-loving if there's evil in the world?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *19 hours ago*
@philosophy_nerd That's the classic "problem of evil" - we'll dive deep into that later. Quick version: God is so loving that He allows free will, even when it leads to pain. But He's also powerful enough to ultimately redeem all suffering.

what about God's wrath though? that doesn't sound loving

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *17 hours ago*
@progressive_christian God's wrath is actually His love in action against anything that destroys what He loves. Like a parent's anger at someone hurting their child. It's not petty rage - it's perfect justice defending the innocent.

**@anxious_perfectionist** • *12 hours ago*
does God love me even when I mess up constantly?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *11 hours ago*
@anxious_perfectionist Yes! God's love isn't based on your performance. He loves you completely while also working to transform you. You're not a project to Him - you're a child.

**@spiritual_seeker** • *8 hours ago*
how do we actually experience God's character personally?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *7 hours ago*
@spiritual_seeker Through prayer, Scripture, community, and just living life with Him. As you walk with God, you'll experience His faithfulness, comfort, guidance, and love firsthand.
