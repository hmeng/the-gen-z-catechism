**Is the Bible actually God's Word? üìö‚ö°Ô∏è**

With all the talk about contradictions, the "telephone game," and it being written by humans thousands of years ago, how can we trust that the Bible is actually from God?

**Here's the deal:** The Bible is both fully human and fully divine. Real people wrote it in their own styles and contexts, but God guided the process so that what they wrote is exactly what He wanted to communicate.

Think of it like a songwriter working with different artists. Each artist brings their unique style, but the songwriter ensures the message comes through clearly. Same song, different voices.

**The Bible isn't a magic book that fell from heaven - it's God speaking through human authors to communicate His truth to us.**

but we have manuscripts that differ from each other. how do we know what the original said?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@skeptical_scholar Great point! But the differences are mostly spelling variations and word order - not major doctrinal changes. We have more ancient manuscripts of the Bible than any other ancient text, and they're remarkably consistent.

if Wikipedia can be edited by anyone and we don't trust it, why trust a book edited by humans for centuries?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@wikipedia_fact_checker The difference is intention and preservation process. Wikipedia is designed to be edited; the Bible was preserved with extreme care. Plus, we can trace the textual history and verify accuracy through thousands of manuscripts.

**@progressive_christian** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what about all the violent parts in the Old Testament? did God really command genocide?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@progressive_christian Those are some of the hardest passages in Scripture. Remember that describing something isn't the same as endorsing it, and God's judgment on specific nations at specific times doesn't create a general principle for us today.

**@science_minded** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what about when the Bible seems to contradict science, like with creation or the flood?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@science_minded The Bible's purpose isn't to be a science textbook - it's to tell us who God is and how to know Him. Many passages use metaphorical or symbolic language appropriate for their original audience.

**@biblical_literalist** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
either the Bible is literally true word-for-word or it's not God's word at all

**@thoughtful_reader** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@biblical_literalist but even Jesus used parables (stories) to teach truth. maybe the Bible uses different literary styles to communicate different kinds of truth?

**@historical_skeptic** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
how do we know the right books made it into the Bible? what about the apocrypha?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@historical_skeptic The process took time, but the church recognized (not decided) which books had divine authority based on apostolic authorship, consistency with established doctrine, and widespread acceptance.

**@translation_questions** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
if it's been translated so many times, isn't it like playing telephone?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@translation_questions Modern translations go back to the original languages (Hebrew/Greek), not through multiple translations. It's more like having multiple people translate the same speech independently.

**@practical_reader** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
this is interesting but how does this affect how I read the Bible day-to-day?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@practical_reader It means you can trust what you're reading! You don't have to be a scholar to understand God's main message, but good study habits (context, genre, cross-references) help you understand it better.

**@former_fundamentalist** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
I used to think every word was dictated by God. this sounds more balanced

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@former_fundamentalist Exactly! God's inspiration doesn't erase human personality or context - it works through them. The Bible is 100% God's word and 100% human words.
