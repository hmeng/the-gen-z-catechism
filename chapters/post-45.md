# Post #45: How do we grow in faith?

---

## üì± Post #45

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*

**How do we actually grow in faith? Is it automatic or do we do something? üå±üí™**

I want to grow spiritually but I'm not sure how. Is it just time? Effort? Does God do it all? What's my role vs. His role?

**Growth happens through God's power and your participation.** It's not automatic (you have to engage), but it's not all up to you either (you need God's help). Think of it like physical fitness - you have to work out, but your body has to respond.

**Spiritual growth happens through:**
- **Scripture** - God's word transforms your mind
- **Prayer** - conversation with God changes your heart
- **Community** - other believers sharpen you
- **Trials** - difficulties develop character
- **Service** - using your gifts builds others up

**You can't manufacture spiritual growth, but you can position yourself for it.**

I thought becoming a Christian would make me automatically better. why is growth so slow?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@instant_transformation Salvation is instant, but sanctification is a process! God makes you a new creation immediately, but becoming like Jesus takes a lifetime. Be patient with yourself - God is patient with you.

**@spiritual_disciplines** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
what about spiritual disciplines? are they required or just helpful?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@spiritual_disciplines They're not required for salvation but they're essential for growth! Like exercise and nutrition for physical health. Prayer, Bible reading, fasting, etc. are ways God meets you and changes you.

what about spiritual dry seasons? sometimes I don't feel like I'm growing at all

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@dry_seasons Dry seasons are normal! Sometimes you grow more during difficult times than easy ones. Growth isn't always emotional - God may be working on character, patience, or faith when you can't feel it.

**@comparative_spirituality** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
I compare my spiritual growth to others and feel discouraged. how do I stop?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@comparative_spirituality God works uniquely in each person! Some people are naturally more emotional, others more intellectual. Focus on your own journey with God, not others' highlight reels. Are you more like Jesus than last year?

**@role_of_trials** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
why does God allow trials if He loves us? how do difficulties help us grow?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@role_of_trials Trials develop character you can't get any other way - patience, compassion, dependence on God. They're not fun, but they're often the most transformative experiences. God uses them to make you more like Jesus.

**@spiritual_gifts** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what about spiritual gifts? how do I discover and use mine?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@spiritual_gifts Pay attention to what energizes you and what others affirm about you. Try different ways of serving. Your gifts often become clear through use, not just introspection. Ask others what they see in you.

**@accountability_importance** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
why is community so important for growth? can't I just grow through personal Bible study?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@accountability_importance Personal study is crucial! But you have blind spots and need others to point them out. Community provides encouragement, accountability, and opportunities to serve. We grow faster together than alone.

**@perfectionism_in_growth** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
I get frustrated when I fail or struggle with the same sins. am I even growing?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@perfectionism_in_growth Growth isn't linear! You'll have setbacks and struggles. The question is: are you still fighting sin and seeking God? Are you more aware of your need for grace? That's growth, even if it's messy.

**@practical_next_steps** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
this sounds good but what are practical next steps for someone who wants to grow?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@practical_next_steps Start simple: daily Bible reading, regular prayer, find a church community, serve somewhere, ask a mature believer to mentor you. Pick one area and focus on it consistently rather than trying to do everything at once.

**@spiritual_plateaus** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
I feel like I've plateaued spiritually. how do I get unstuck?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@spiritual_plateaus Try something new! Serve in a different way, study a different book of the Bible, pray in a new way, join a different group. Sometimes we need fresh challenges to stimulate growth.
