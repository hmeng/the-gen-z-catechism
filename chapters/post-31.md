# Post #31: Why did Jesus come?

## üì± Post #31

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 weeks ago*

**Why did Jesus come? Couldn't God have saved us another way? üåç‚ú®**

If God is all-powerful, why go through the whole incarnation thing? Seems complicated. Why not just snap His fingers and fix everything?

**Jesus came to do what we couldn't do.** He had to:
1. **Live the perfect life** we failed to live
2. **Die the death** we deserved to die  
3. **Rise again** to prove He conquered sin and death
4. **Show us what God is like** in human terms

Think of it like this: If you owed a debt you couldn't pay, someone would have to actually pay it - not just pretend it doesn't exist. Jesus didn't just declare us forgiven; He actually dealt with our sin.

**God chose the incarnation because it's the only way to be both perfectly just and perfectly loving.**

but if God is all-powerful, couldn't he just change the rules? why does justice matter so much?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
@omnipotence_questions God can't contradict His own nature. He's not just powerful - He's perfectly just. Changing the rules would make Him unjust. True love requires justice, especially for victims of evil.

**@alternative_atonement** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
what about other ways God could have saved us? why specifically Jesus dying?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
@alternative_atonement Any other way would either compromise God's justice or fail to address our real need. Jesus' death was the only way to satisfy justice while offering mercy. It's not arbitrary - it's necessary.

**@moral_influence_theory** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
maybe Jesus just came to show us how to live? be a good example?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
@moral_influence_theory Jesus is definitely a perfect example! But examples don't pay debts or remove guilt. We needed more than inspiration - we needed rescue. Jesus did both.

**@why_incarnation** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
why couldn't God just forgive from heaven? why become human?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@why_incarnation Because forgiveness isn't just overlooking wrong - it's dealing with it. Someone had to pay the price for sin. Only a human could represent us, but only God could pay an infinite debt.

**@substitution_confusion** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
how is it fair for Jesus to be punished for things he didn't do?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@substitution_confusion Jesus voluntarily took our place - He wasn't forced. It's like someone choosing to pay your debt. The unfairness is actually in our favor - He took what we deserved so we could receive what He deserved.

**@theodicy_questions** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
if Jesus came to fix sin, why is there still evil in the world?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@theodicy_questions Jesus' first coming dealt with the penalty of sin and started the process of defeating it. His second coming will finish the job - no more sin, death, or suffering.

**@practical_application** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
this is interesting theology but what does it mean for me today?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@practical_application It means you're completely loved and completely forgiven. Jesus didn't just tolerate your sin - He removed it. You can have a relationship with God without fear or shame.

**@multiple_religions** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
other religions have savior figures too. what makes Jesus unique?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@multiple_religions Jesus is unique because He's both fully God and fully human, and He actually rose from the dead. Other religious figures point toward God; Jesus IS God who came to save us.

**@emotional_impact** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
thinking about God becoming human and dying for me is overwhelming. how do I process this?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@emotional_impact That's the right response! The cross is meant to be overwhelming - it's the ultimate demonstration of love. Let it sink in slowly. You don't have to understand it fully to receive it gratefully.

**@historical_evidence** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
how do we know this actually happened? what's the evidence for Jesus' life, death, and resurrection?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@historical_evidence Great question! The historical evidence is surprisingly strong - multiple independent sources, enemy attestation, and the dramatic transformation of the disciples. We'll dive deeper into the resurrection evidence in future posts.
