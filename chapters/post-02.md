**How do we know God exists? 🔬🙏**

Honestly, with all the Neil deGrasse Tyson content and Reddit atheists, how can we actually know there's a God? Isn't it just wishful thinking?

**Here's the deal:** God has revealed Himself in two main ways. First, through creation itself - the universe's complexity, moral law written on our hearts, and that deep sense that there's something more. Second, through Scripture - God's direct communication to humanity.

It's like this: if you found a perfectly organized playlist, you'd assume someone curated it. The universe is infinitely more complex and organized than any playlist. The moral outrage you feel about injustice? That's evidence of a moral lawgiver.

**Plus, the fact that you're even asking this question shows you're wired to seek God. That's not accidental.**

this is just god of the gaps reasoning. science explains complexity through evolution

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *22 hours ago*
@reddit_atheist I hear you! But even if evolution explains how complexity developed, it doesn't explain why there's something rather than nothing, or why the universe follows rational laws that our minds can understand. That's not gaps - that's the whole picture.

what about all the different religions though? how do we know which one is right?

**@philosophy_student** • *18 hours ago*
@spiritual_but_not_religious that's like saying "there are different theories in science, so science must be wrong." maybe there's truth to discover, and some religions are closer to it than others

I feel God in nature and crystals and stuff. why do we need the Bible?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *15 hours ago*
@tiktok_spirituality Those feelings are valid! God does reveal Himself through creation. But general revelation (nature) tells us there's a God, while special revelation (Scripture) tells us who He is and how to know Him personally.

but what about the Big Bang? doesn't that prove the universe created itself?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *11 hours ago*
@science_major The Big Bang actually supports theism! It shows the universe had a beginning, which means it needed a cause outside itself. What caused the Big Bang? That's where God comes in.

I want to believe but what if I'm just believing because I need comfort?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *6 hours ago*
@anxious_doubter That's actually a healthy question! The need for comfort doesn't make something false - we need water because water exists. But test your beliefs against evidence, not just feelings.

I used to believe but then I learned about suffering and evil. how does that fit?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *2 hours ago*
@former_christian That's one of the hardest questions, and we'll tackle it in depth later. But here's a preview: the existence of evil actually presupposes objective moral standards, which points to God.
