# Post #34: What is faith?

## 📱 Post #34

**What is faith? Blind belief? Positive thinking? Hoping for the best? 🤔💭**

People use "faith" to mean everything from wishful thinking to confident belief. But what does saving faith actually look like?

**Faith is knowledge + agreement + trust.** It's not blind - you need to know something about Jesus. It's not just intellectual - you need to agree it's true. But most importantly, you need to trust Him personally.

Think of it like getting on an airplane. You have knowledge (planes can fly), agreement (this plane looks airworthy), but faith is actually boarding and trusting the pilot with your life.

**Saving faith isn't perfect faith - it's faith in a perfect Savior. Even weak faith in Jesus saves you.**

**@intellectual_doubter** • *4 days ago*
but I have so many questions and doubts. can someone with doubts have real faith?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *3 days ago*
@intellectual_doubter Absolutely! Doubt and faith can coexist. The man in the Gospels said "I believe; help my unbelief!" Honest doubts can actually strengthen faith when you work through them.

**@positive_thinking** • *3 days ago*
isn't faith just positive thinking? believing good things will happen?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *3 days ago*
@positive_thinking No, faith has an object - Jesus. Positive thinking is about your attitude; faith is about trusting a person. You can have faith even when you don't feel positive about your circumstances.

**@blind_faith_objection** • *3 days ago*
religious people always talk about "blind faith" but that seems irrational

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *3 days ago*
@blind_faith_objection True faith isn't blind! It's based on evidence about who Jesus is and what He's done. You can't have all the answers, but faith isn't a leap in the dark - it's a step toward the light.

**@works_and_faith** • *2 days ago*
what about the verse that says "faith without works is dead"? don't works matter?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *2 days ago*
@works_and_faith Works don't create faith, but they do prove it! If someone truly trusts Jesus, their life will change. Works are the evidence of faith, not the basis of it.

**@emotional_faith** • *2 days ago*
I don't feel very faithful most of the time. does that mean I don't have real faith?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *2 days ago*
@emotional_faith Faith isn't a feeling! You can trust Jesus even when you don't feel emotional about it. Faith is a decision to rely on Him regardless of your emotions.

**@certainty_levels** • *1 day ago*
how certain do I need to be? what if I'm only like 70% sure?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *1 day ago*
@certainty_levels Faith isn't about percentage certainty - it's about who you're trusting. Even if you're uncertain about some things, you can still trust Jesus with what you do know about Him.

**@faith_vs_reason** • *1 day ago*
doesn't faith contradict reason and science?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *1 day ago*
@faith_vs_reason Faith and reason work together! You use reason to evaluate evidence about Jesus, then trust Him based on that evidence. Faith goes beyond reason but doesn't contradict it.

so do I need to "decide" to have faith? what if I can't make myself believe?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *19 hours ago*
@decision_theology Faith is both a human choice and a gift from God. You can't manufacture belief, but you can respond to God's grace when He opens your heart. Ask Him to help your unbelief!

**@temporary_faith** • *15 hours ago*
what if I believed before but now I'm struggling? did I lose my faith?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *14 hours ago*
@temporary_faith Struggling with faith doesn't mean you've lost it! Sometimes faith feels weak, but if you're still turning to Jesus in your struggles, that's actually faith in action.

**@childlike_faith** • *10 hours ago*
what about "childlike faith"? does that mean not thinking too hard?

**@TheGenZCatechism** • *9 hours ago*
@childlike_faith Childlike faith means trusting simply, not thinking simplistically. Children trust their parents even when they don't understand everything. You can use your mind while still trusting like a child.
