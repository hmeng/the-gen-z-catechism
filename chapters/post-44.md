# Post #44: What is the law for?

## üì± Post #44

**What is God's law actually for? Are we under it or not? üìú‚öñÔ∏è**

I'm confused about the law. Some say we're "free from the law," others say we should follow it. What's the deal with Old Testament rules?

**The law serves three purposes:**

1. **Mirror** - shows us our sin and need for Jesus
2. **Restraint** - limits evil in society  
3. **Guide** - shows Christians how to live

Think of it like this: you're not trying to earn God's approval by following rules (that's already settled), but you follow them because they show you how to love God and others well.

**You're not under the law for salvation, but you use the law for guidance. It's like GPS - not your master, but your helper.**

so do we still have to follow Old Testament laws? what about dietary restrictions and sabbath?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@old_testament_relevance Good question! The moral law (10 commandments) still applies. Ceremonial laws (sacrifices, dietary rules) were fulfilled in Christ. Civil laws were for Israel specifically. Focus on the heart behind the law.

**@legalism_vs_antinomianism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
how do I avoid both legalism (too much focus on rules) and antinomianism (no rules at all)?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@legalism_vs_antinomianism Great balance question! Legalism says "obey to be saved." Antinomianism says "I'm saved so obedience doesn't matter." The gospel says "I'm saved so I want to obey." It's about motivation, not just behavior.

**@ten_commandments_today** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
are the Ten Commandments still relevant in 2024?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@ten_commandments_today Absolutely! They're timeless principles for human flourishing. Don't worship idols, don't murder, don't commit adultery, don't steal - these protect relationships and society. The heart issues they address are still relevant.

**@sermon_on_the_mount** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
what about Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount? that seems like even stricter rules

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@sermon_on_the_mount Jesus wasn't adding more rules - He was showing the heart behind the law. It's not just about external behavior but internal attitudes. The law goes deeper than actions to motives.

**@sabbath_observance** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
do Christians need to keep the Sabbath? what does that look like today?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@sabbath_observance The Sabbath principle (rest and worship) is still important for human flourishing. You need rhythm of work and rest. Christians often celebrate this on Sunday, but the key is regular rest and worship.

**@moral_relativism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
isn't God's law just ancient morality? shouldn't we update it for modern times?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@moral_relativism God's moral law reflects His unchanging character, not just ancient preferences. Core principles like love, justice, and faithfulness are timeless. Application may vary, but the heart principles remain constant.

**@gentile_christians** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about Gentile Christians? the law was given to Israel, not us

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@gentile_christians True! Gentiles were never under the Mosaic law for salvation. But the moral principles behind the law reflect God's character and are good for all people. You're not bound by the law, but you can benefit from its wisdom.

**@conviction_vs_condemnation** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
how do I tell the difference between healthy conviction and condemning guilt?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@conviction_vs_condemnation Conviction says "you did wrong, but you can be forgiven and change." Condemnation says "you are wrong and hopeless." The Holy Spirit convicts to restore; Satan condemns to destroy.

**@cultural_application** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
how do we apply ancient laws to modern situations like social media, technology, etc.?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@cultural_application Look for the principle behind the law, then apply it to new situations. "Don't bear false witness" applies to social media gossip. "Don't covet" applies to Instagram comparison. The heart issues are the same.

**@grace_and_truth** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
how do we balance grace and truth? being loving but not compromising standards?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@grace_and_truth Jesus was "full of grace and truth" - not grace vs. truth. Truth without grace is harsh; grace without truth is cheap. Hold high standards while offering abundant mercy for failure.
