# Post #21: Did humans mess up?

## üì± Post #21

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*

**Did humans mess up? Like, was everything perfect before? üçéüíî**

With all the chaos in the world - wars, climate crisis, mental health epidemics, toxic relationships - was it always like this? Or did we break something that was supposed to be beautiful?

**Yes, humans messed up.** The first humans chose to rebel against God, and it broke everything. Not just individual hearts, but the whole system. Death, pain, broken relationships, environmental destruction - it all traces back to that first "no" to God.

Think of it like this: imagine a computer virus that doesn't just crash one program, but corrupts the entire operating system. That's what sin did to creation. Everything still works, but nothing works the way it's supposed to.

**But here's the thing: we're not just victims of Adam's choice. We would have made the same choice. We ALL choose rebellion every day.**

**@climate_grief** ‚Ä¢ *2 weeks ago*
so the environmental crisis is because of some ancient fruit eating? that seems unfair to blame on Adam

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@climate_grief Not directly! The Fall introduced brokenness into creation, but current environmental issues are largely from our own choices. We're responsible for our actions, not Adam's. But his rebellion did break the harmony between humans and nature.

**@original_sin_skeptic** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
why should I be responsible for something someone else did thousands of years ago?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@original_sin_skeptic You're not responsible for Adam's sin specifically - you're responsible for your own sins. But we all inherit the broken human nature. It's like inheriting a genetic predisposition - not your fault, but your reality.

**@evolution_questions** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
if evolution is true, how do we understand Adam and Eve? were they literal people?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@evolution_questions Christians have different views on this. Some see Adam and Eve as literal first humans, others as representatives of early humanity. Either way, the point is that human moral consciousness involved a real choice to rebel against God.

**@mental_health_perspective** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
so my depression and anxiety are because someone ate fruit? that's not helping my mental health

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@mental_health_perspective Your mental health isn't punishment for Adam's sin! But the Fall did introduce brokenness that affects our minds and bodies. The good news is that Jesus came to heal all kinds of brokenness, including mental illness.

**@philosophical_objection** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
if God knew they would sin, why create them? seems like setting them up to fail

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@philosophical_objection That's one of the deepest questions in theology! God could have created robots who never sin, but then love wouldn't be real. Real love requires the possibility of rejection. The risk was worth it for genuine relationship.

**@systemic_injustice** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about systemic racism, sexism, etc? is that all from the Fall too?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@systemic_injustice Yes! The Fall affects individuals AND systems. Racism, sexism, classism - these are all manifestations of the broken human heart creating broken structures. That's why fighting injustice is kingdom work.

**@science_of_altruism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
but humans also do good things. we have empathy, altruism, heroism. doesn't that contradict total depravity?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@science_of_altruism Great point! Humans still bear God's image even after the Fall. We're capable of good, but we're also fundamentally self-centered. Even our "good" actions are often mixed with selfish motives.

**@trauma_informed** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
this is hard because I experienced abuse. did God plan that? is it my fault somehow?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@trauma_informed I'm so sorry you experienced that. God didn't plan your abuse - that's the result of human sin and brokenness. You're not responsible for what others did to you. The Fall explains why evil exists without making God the author of evil.

**@hopeful_but_realistic** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
so is there any hope? or are we just stuck in this broken world?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@hopeful_but_realistic There's incredible hope! The Fall is the bad news that makes the good news so good. Jesus came to fix what Adam broke - not just individual hearts, but the whole creation. That's what the rest of this catechism is about.
