# Post #26: What about good works?

## üì± Post #26

**What about good works? Don't they count for something? ü§ùüíù**

I volunteer, donate to charity, help my friends, try to be a good person. Surely that matters to God? What about all the good I do?

**Good works are important, but they can't save you.** Think of it like this: if you're $100,000 in debt, volunteering at a soup kitchen is beautiful, but it doesn't pay off your debt. You need someone else to cover what you owe.

Your good works are real and valuable! They reflect God's image in you, help others, and show your character. But they're not enough to bridge the gap between you and a perfect God.

**Good works are the fruit of salvation, not the root of it. You don't work for salvation - you work from salvation.**

but doesn't the Bible say "faith without works is dead"? seems like works matter

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@volunteer_coordinator Absolutely! That verse (James 2:17) says that real faith naturally produces good works. But it's not that works save you - it's that saving faith always results in good works. The works prove the faith, not create it.

this sounds like it could make people passive about fighting injustice

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@social_justice_warrior Actually the opposite! When you're saved by grace, you're free to do good without trying to earn approval. Some of history's greatest justice work has been done by people who were secure in God's love.

**@karma_believer** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
what about karma? don't our actions have consequences?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@karma_believer Actions do have consequences! But karma is about earning what you deserve, while Christianity is about receiving what you don't deserve (grace). Both acknowledge that actions matter, but they have different solutions.

**@moral_scorecard** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
if good works don't save us, what's the point of being good?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@moral_scorecard Great question! You be good because it's right, it helps others, it reflects God's character, and it flows from gratitude for salvation. The motivation changes from "I have to" to "I get to."

**@comparative_religion** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
most religions emphasize good works. why is Christianity different?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@comparative_religion Most religions are about reaching up to God through effort. Christianity is about God reaching down to us through Jesus. It's not about earning God's love - it's about receiving it.

**@humanitarian_atheist** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
I do good works without believing in God. are mine worthless?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@humanitarian_atheist Your good works are absolutely valuable! They help people and reflect God's image in you (whether you believe in Him or not). They just can't save you from sin. But they're not worthless at all.

I was raised thinking I had to earn God's love. this is actually freeing

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@religious_trauma I'm so glad this is freeing for you! Performance-based Christianity is exhausting and unbiblical. God's love is a gift, not a paycheck. You can rest in that love.

**@works_righteousness** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
but surely some people are better than others? doesn't that count for something?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@works_righteousness Some people do cause less harm than others, and that's good! But the standard isn't "better than others" - it's "perfect like God." Even the best person falls short of that standard.

**@practical_christian** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
so how do good works fit into the Christian life?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@practical_christian Good works are the natural overflow of a transformed heart. You don't work to become a Christian - you work because you are a Christian. They're evidence of faith, not the basis of it.
