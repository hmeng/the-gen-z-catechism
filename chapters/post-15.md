**What did God want from the first humans? üåçüë•**

Was it obedience? Worship? Perfection? And with climate change and environmental crisis, what does "dominion over creation" actually mean?

**God wanted relationship and responsible stewardship.** He created humans to know Him, reflect His character, and care for creation as His representatives. Think of it like being trusted with a friend's house - you're in charge, but you're accountable.

"Dominion" doesn't mean domination or exploitation. It means being God's caretakers of the world, protecting and nurturing it the way God would. Every environmental crisis is actually a failure to fulfill our original calling.

**You're called to be God's ambassador to creation - representing His love and care for everything He made.**

finally! so many Christians ignore environmental responsibility. this is our job!

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@climate_activist Exactly! Creation care is a core Christian calling, not optional. God gave us this world to tend, not to trash.

**@old_earth_skeptic** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
but didn't God say to "subdue" the earth? doesn't that mean we can use it however we want?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@old_earth_skeptic "Subdue" in Hebrew means to cultivate and manage, like a gardener with a garden. It's about responsible development, not destructive exploitation.

**@overwhelmed_gen_z** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
this feels like so much pressure. we inherited a messed-up planet and now it's our responsibility to fix it?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@overwhelmed_gen_z I get that! You inherited problems you didn't create. But you also inherited the calling and ability to be part of the solution. God doesn't expect you to fix everything alone - work with others and trust Him.

**@environmental_science** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
what about extinction, natural disasters, etc? is that part of God's plan or human failure?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@environmental_science Some environmental problems are natural (like volcanoes), others are human-caused (like pollution). Our job is to work with natural systems, not against them, and to minimize harm from our choices.

**@dominion_theology** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
doesn't this contradict the idea that this world is temporary and heaven is our real home?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@dominion_theology Not at all! God will ultimately make all things new, but that doesn't mean we trash the current world. We're called to be faithful stewards until Jesus returns.

**@animal_rights** ‚Ä¢ *20 hours ago*
what about animal welfare? does dominion include protecting animals?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *19 hours ago*
@animal_rights Absolutely! A good steward cares for all of creation, including animals. We're called to reflect God's character, and He cares for every creature.

**@technological_progress** ‚Ä¢ *18 hours ago*
what about technology and development? is it wrong to change the natural world?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *17 hours ago*
@technological_progress Technology isn't inherently wrong! God gave us creativity and intelligence to develop and improve things. The question is whether our innovations help or harm creation and human flourishing.

**@indigenous_wisdom** ‚Ä¢ *15 hours ago*
indigenous peoples have been better stewards than colonizers. maybe we should listen to them?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *14 hours ago*
@indigenous_wisdom Great point! Many indigenous cultures have practiced excellent stewardship for generations. There's wisdom in traditional ecological knowledge that we should definitely learn from.

**@overwhelmed_individual** ‚Ä¢ *12 hours ago*
this is overwhelming. what can one person actually do?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *11 hours ago*
@overwhelmed_individual Start small! Choose sustainable options when possible, reduce waste, support responsible companies, vote for environmental policies, and remember - you're part of a global community of people who care.

**@corporate_responsibility** ‚Ä¢ *8 hours ago*
shouldn't corporations and governments do more instead of putting it all on individuals?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *7 hours ago*
@corporate_responsibility Both! Individual responsibility AND systemic change are needed. We each do our part while also advocating for larger policy changes. Don't let the big picture paralyze your personal action.
