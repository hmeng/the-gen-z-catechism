## üì± Post #1

**What's the point of life anyway? ü§î**

Like seriously, with everything going on in the world, what's the actual point? Is it just to be happy? To make money? To go viral? To save the planet?

**The real answer:** You were created to know God and enjoy Him forever. That's your main character energy right there. Not self-optimization, not grinding 24/7, not even changing the world (though that's cool too). Your purpose is to be in relationship with the God who made you, and to reflect His glory in everything you do.

Think of it like this: You're not the protagonist of your own story trying to write your own meaning. You're a beloved character in God's epic story, and your purpose is to play your part in showing the world what He's like.

but what if I don't believe in God? am I just meaningless then?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *58 minutes ago*
Not at all! Even if you don't believe yet, you still have infinite worth because you're made in God's image. Your disbelief doesn't change your value. But it might explain why you feel that existential void - we're wired for relationship with our Creator.

this sounds like wishful thinking though. just because we want meaning doesn't mean there is any

**@coffee_and_theology** ‚Ä¢ *32 minutes ago*
@philosophymajor fair point! but consider this: the fact that we all crave meaning and purpose might actually be evidence that we're designed for it. like how hunger points to the existence of food

ok but what about all the pressure to be successful and make something of yourself? my parents spent so much on college...

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *25 minutes ago*
@anxious_achiever Success isn't wrong! But when it becomes your ultimate purpose, it becomes an idol that will eventually disappoint you. God can use your talents and education for His glory AND your fulfillment. It's not either/or.

this is actually comforting. I've been so burned out trying to find my "passion" and "purpose" in my career

**@spiritual_not_religious** ‚Ä¢ *12 minutes ago*
I like this but why specifically the Christian God? what about other religions?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *8 minutes ago*
@spiritual_not_religious Great question! We'll get to that in future posts about how we know God exists and what makes Christianity unique. Short answer: because Jesus is the way God revealed Himself most clearly to us.

but what if the universe is just random chaos and we're all gonna die anyway?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 minutes ago*
@nihilistic_gen_z That's exactly the kind of despair that makes sense if there's no God. But what if the universe isn't random? What if your life has cosmic significance? That's what we're exploring here.
