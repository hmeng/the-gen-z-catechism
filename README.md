## Theological Framework

**Reformed Distinctives Addressed:**
- Scripture as ultimate authority
- Total depravity and human inability
- Unconditional election and perseverance of the saints
- Substitutionary atonement and justification by faith alone
- Sanctification as Spirit-led transformation
- Eschatological hope in Christ's return

**Contemporary Applications:**
- Mental health and spiritual formation
- Social justice as gospel imperative
- Technology ethics and digital discipleship
- Environmental stewardship as creation care
- Political engagement without idolatry

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Gen Z believers (ages 18-27) seeking to understand their faith more deeply

**Secondary**: 
- Millennial parents wanting to engage their Gen Z children
- Youth pastors and campus ministers
- Older generations seeking to understand Gen Z perspectives
- Seekers curious about Christianity

## Resources for Leaders

### Discussion Starters
Each post includes natural conversation prompts through its comment threads, making it easy for leaders to facilitate group discussions.

### Cultural Bridge-Building
The format helps older leaders understand Gen Z concerns while introducing younger audiences to Reformed theology.

### Pastoral Care
Comments address common pastoral issues: anxiety, doubt, trauma, relationships, purpose, and identity.

## Innovation in Catechetical Teaching

This project represents a new approach to catechetical instruction that:
- Meets people where they are (social media)
