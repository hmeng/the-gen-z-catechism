**Is anyone truly innocent? What about babies? Good people? üë∂üòá**

Some people seem genuinely good - they help others, live peacefully, never hurt anyone. And what about children who die young? Are they guilty of sin they never committed?

**All humans are affected by sin, but not all are equally guilty.** Think of it like this: everyone inherits the same broken human nature, but some people act on it more than others. A baby isn't guilty of actual sins, but they're still born with the capacity for selfishness.

This isn't about God being harsh - it's about understanding that sin is deeper than actions. It's a condition we all share, even if we express it differently.

**The good news: Jesus saves both the "worst" sinners and the "best" people, because we all need salvation.**

but babies don't choose to be selfish. how can they be responsible for sin?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@child_development You're absolutely right! Babies aren't responsible for sins they haven't committed. They inherit a corrupted nature, but they're not guilty of actual sins. God's justice takes into account what people know and choose.

**@moral_hierarchy** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
so are some people "more sinful" than others? that doesn't seem fair

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@moral_hierarchy People do cause different amounts of harm, and that matters! But the point is that everyone - from the kindest person to the cruelest - needs salvation. It's not about ranking sin levels.

what happens to babies who die? are they condemned?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@infant_mortality Most Christians believe babies who die are covered by God's grace. They haven't rejected Christ because they haven't had the capacity to choose. God's justice and mercy are both perfect.

**@good_person_syndrome** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
I've lived a good life, helped people, never hurt anyone. why would I need salvation?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@good_person_syndrome Your good life is genuinely good! But the question isn't whether you're good compared to others - it's whether you're perfect before God. Even the best people have selfish moments, prideful thoughts, or mixed motives.

**@cultural_relativism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
different cultures have different ideas about what's sinful though

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@cultural_relativism True! But across cultures, people recognize basic things like murder, betrayal, and selfishness are wrong. The specifics vary, but the underlying moral sense is universal.

**@psychological_perspective** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
isn't this just about brain development and socialization? not spiritual corruption?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@psychological_perspective Brain development and socialization definitely affect behavior! But they don't fully explain why even well-raised people in good environments still struggle with selfishness and moral failures.

**@degrees_of_sin** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
so is lying as bad as murder? that seems extreme

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@degrees_of_sin Not at all! Actions have different consequences and cause different amounts of harm. The point is that all sin - big or small - separates us from God. A small crack in a dam is still a crack.

**@nature_vs_nurture** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
what about people raised in terrible circumstances? are they really responsible?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@nature_vs_nurture Circumstances definitely matter! God is perfectly just and takes into account what people know, what they've experienced, and what choices they've had. But environment doesn't eliminate moral responsibility entirely.

**@hope_for_humanity** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
this sounds hopeless. is there any good news?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@hope_for_humanity This is actually the setup for the best news ever! Because everyone needs salvation, Jesus came to save everyone who trusts in Him. The universal problem has a universal solution.
