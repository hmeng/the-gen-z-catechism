**What's the deal with judgment day? Is God really going to judge everyone? ‚öñÔ∏èüë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è**

This sounds terrifying and vindictive. Like, didn't Jesus already take care of everything? Why do we need a final judgment?

**Here's what's happening:** God will finally and publicly right every wrong. Every injustice will be exposed, every victim will be vindicated, and every perpetrator will be held accountable.

**For Christians:** You've already been judged in Jesus. Your judgment day was at the cross. The final judgment is when that verdict becomes public and final.

**Why public judgment?** Because private injustice demands public justice. Every secret abuse, every systemic oppression, every hidden evil will be brought into the light.

**This isn't about God being mean - it's about God being just. Finally.**

ok but what about all the injustices that never get resolved in this life? what about systemic racism and abuse?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@social_justice_warrior EXACTLY. That's why judgment day matters. Every racist act, every abuse of power, every systemic injustice - it all gets dealt with. Perfect justice, finally.

**@anxious_christian** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
but what if I'm not actually saved? what if I'm deceiving myself?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@anxious_christian The fact that you're concerned about this probably shows you ARE saved. Those who are truly self-deceived don't usually worry about self-deception.

**@universalist_hope** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
this seems harsh. what about people who never heard about Jesus?

**@missionary_kid** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@universalist_hope God is perfectly just and perfectly loving. He'll judge according to what people knew and how they responded to it. But this is also why missions matter.

**@trauma_survivor** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
the idea of my abuser being held accountable... that's actually comforting

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@trauma_survivor Yes. Your pain matters to God. Your abuser won't get away with it. Justice will be done, even if it wasn't done in this life.

**@philosophical_skeptic** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
but who decides what's right and wrong? seems subjective

**@moral_realist** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@philosophical_skeptic if morality is subjective then why does everyone agree that torturing babies for fun is wrong? some things are objectively evil

**@perfectionist_christian** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
wait so Christians don't get judged for their sins at all?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@perfectionist_christian Your sins were already judged - in Jesus. But Christians will still give an account for how they lived, though not for salvation. It's more like a performance review than a criminal trial.

**@hell_questioning** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
what about hell though? is that really necessary?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@hell_questioning Hell is the logical consequence of rejecting God. It's not arbitrary punishment - it's the natural result of choosing to live without the source of all goodness and life.

**@climate_justice** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
what about environmental destruction? will that be judged too?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@climate_justice Absolutely! Destroying God's creation will be held accountable. Environmental stewardship is part of our calling, and failure to care for creation is a justice issue.

**@corrupt_leaders** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what about politicians and leaders who abuse their power? they never seem to face consequences

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@corrupt_leaders That's exactly what final judgment is for! Every abuse of power, every corruption, every exploitation of the vulnerable will be exposed and judged. No one escapes accountability.

**@mercy_questions** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
but I thought God was merciful? this sounds like only wrath

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@mercy_questions God's mercy is real and available now! But mercy refused becomes judgment. God's justice IS mercy for the oppressed and abused. Perfect love requires perfect justice.
