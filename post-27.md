**What is God's justice? Is God actually loving if He punishes people? ‚öñÔ∏èüíî**

The whole "God of wrath" thing seems to contradict "God is love." If God is truly loving, why doesn't He just forgive everyone? Why does justice even matter?

**God's justice IS His love in action.** When you love someone, you hate what hurts them. When you love justice, you hate injustice. God's wrath isn't petty anger - it's perfect love defending what's right.

Think of it like this: if you saw someone abusing a child, your anger would be righteous. You'd want justice not because you're mean, but because you love the child. God's justice is His love for what's right and His hatred of what's wrong.

**A God who didn't care about justice wouldn't be loving - He'd be indifferent to suffering and evil.**

but won't love ultimately triumph over justice? shouldn't love win?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@universalist_hope Love doesn't triumph over justice - love demands justice! If someone murdered your loved one, would you want the judge to just let them go? Love for the victim requires justice for the crime.

this actually comforts me. my abuser never faced consequences. knowing God will ultimately hold them accountable helps

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 week ago*
@abuse_survivor I'm so sorry for what you experienced. Yes, God sees every injustice and will ultimately make all things right. Your pain matters to Him, and justice will be done.

**@social_justice_advocate** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
what about systemic injustice? will God judge systems and structures too?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@social_justice_advocate Absolutely! God cares about both individual and systemic justice. Every corrupt system, every oppressive structure, every way power has been abused - it all falls under His judgment.

**@anxious_christian** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
this makes me scared. what if God judges me and finds me lacking?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *6 days ago*
@anxious_christian That's exactly why we need Jesus! He took the judgment you deserved so you could receive the righteousness you don't deserve. In Christ, you don't have to fear God's justice - you can rest in His love.

who decides what's just though? different cultures have different ideas of justice

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *5 days ago*
@moral_relativist That's exactly why we need God's perfect standard! Human ideas of justice are flawed and biased. God's justice is perfect, consistent, and truly righteous.

**@tough_love_skeptic** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
this sounds like "tough love" which is often just abuse justified

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *4 days ago*
@tough_love_skeptic I hear that concern! God's justice isn't arbitrary toughness - it's perfect righteousness. And it's always paired with mercy. He doesn't punish because He enjoys it, but because righteousness demands it.

**@restorative_justice** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
what about restorative vs retributive justice? is God's justice punitive or healing?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *3 days ago*
@restorative_justice God's justice includes both! He restores what's been broken while also requiring that wrong be made right. Perfect justice addresses both the victim's need for vindication and the possibility of restoration.

**@philosophical_objection** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
if God is all-powerful, couldn't He just make everyone good? why allow evil that requires justice?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *2 days ago*
@philosophical_objection God could force goodness, but then it wouldn't be real goodness - it would be programming. Love requires freedom, and freedom makes evil possible. Justice is the response to the evil that freedom allows.

**@mercy_questions** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
how do justice and mercy work together? don't they contradict each other?

**@TheGenZCatechism** ‚Ä¢ *1 day ago*
@mercy_questions They meet at the cross! Jesus receives the justice (punishment for sin) so we can receive the mercy (forgiveness). Both are satisfied - justice is done, mercy is given.
